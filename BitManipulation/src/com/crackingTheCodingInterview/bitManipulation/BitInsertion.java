/**
 * The {@link BitInsertion}
 * <p>
 * You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
 * Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i.
 * <p>
 * You can assume that the bits j through i ahve enough space to fit all of M. That is, 
 * if M = 10011, you can assume that there at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not
 * for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between 3 and bit 2.
 * <p>
 * Example <br>
 * Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6 <br>
 * Output: N = 10001001100
 * <p>
 * The idea is to utilise the update bit mechanism.
