Identical Binary Trees

A binary tree is identical to another tree if you overlay both trees they will be the same. This means that
if you traverse both trees they will have the same order.

A BFS on the tree should expand all the nodes from the top down, if the next nodes to visit for both trees are
the same, then we progress, if they differ then the trees are not the same.
