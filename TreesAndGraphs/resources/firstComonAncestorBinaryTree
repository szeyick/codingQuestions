First Common Ancestor - Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree where there are both left children and right children, however the difference between 
this and a binary search tree is that there is no order in which the nodes are in the tree. Values larger and
smaller than the current value can exist in either subtree, which makes finding the common ancestor slightly
more difficult.

Because we do not know where the the values are in the tree, we need to search through the tree to determine if
the nodes exist in each subtree. We can do a bottom up search (post-order traversal) to pass values in each subtree
back up. This also stops the subtree being searched each time and we should only be required to search through the
tree once.

Algorithm -

- Following the post order traversal by searching left, right, then the current node.
- If the current node contains one of the two valeus we're looking for, we return the current value.
- If only one of the values is returned by its children, then we return that value. This implies to the
  parent that only one of its children contains the two values, meaning that the other one is off a branch
  in one of the parents and we need to search further up.
