 * The {@link IdenticalBinaryTrees}
 * <p>
 * You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of 
 * nodes and T2 with hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to
 * decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.
 * 
 * A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such
 * that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off 
 * the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
