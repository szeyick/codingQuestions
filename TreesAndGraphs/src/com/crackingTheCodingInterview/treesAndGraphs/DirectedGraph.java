/**
 * The {@link DirectedGraph}
 * <p>
 * Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out
 * whether there is a route between two nodes.
 * <p>
 * This question involves a start node and a finish node, and
 * the operation to implement is a "search". If you can find
 * the second node from the first one, it means that there is a
 * path between the two. It may also be beneficial to ask as to
 * whether the nodes are close together or not as it may be more
 * efficient to implement a DFS or BFS depending on how closely the
 * nodes are together or how big the graph is
