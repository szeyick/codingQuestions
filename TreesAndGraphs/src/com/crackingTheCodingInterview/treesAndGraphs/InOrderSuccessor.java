/**
 * The {@link InOrderSuccessor}
 * <p>
 * Write an algorithm to find the "next" node or its
 * in-order successor of a given node in a binary search
 * tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its
 * parent.
 * <p>
 * The link to its parent will allow us to determine if the
 * current node is a left or right child of its parent. If it
 * is the left child, its "next" is its parent, whereas if it
 * is the right child, its "next" will be the smallest child
 * of its grandparent.
