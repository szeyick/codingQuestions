Object Oriented Design - Black Jack

Step 1 - Handle Ambiguity

"Design the data structures for the generic deck of cards. Explain how you could subclass the data structures to
implement blackjack."

For the sake of argument, the deck of cards in this question will mean a normal 52 card deck of playing cards. In 
reality, the cards could be any type of cards so it would be ideal to clarify this part if asked. 

A game of blackjack is usually comprised of the following rules -

- The first person (dealer or player) to reach 21 wins.
- If a person (dealer or player) goes over 21, they bust and are out of the round.
- Each person has a hand, that comprises of 2 cards.
	- They can choose to hit or stay, where hit allows the dealer to give them another card and stay allows them
	  to stay on their current value and passing the turn onto the next player.
	- Each card adds to the total in the persons hand, if they bust at any stage, they are out of the game.
- If the dealer busts, all the players win.

Step 2 - Define the Core Objects

The core objects in this are defined as -

- Card : An individual playing card, contains a suite (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades) and a value (1 -> 13 (Jack, Queen, King).
- Deck : A standard deck of cards is comprised of 52 cards (hearts 1 -> 13, clubs 1 -> 13, diamonds 1 -> 13, spades 1 -> 13).
- Dealer : A dealer manages the deck of cards, it also deals the cards to the players and itself.
- Player : A player is responsible for playing their own hand and can hit or stay.
- Suite : Defines the "type" of card, it being a heart, club, diamond or spade.
- Blackjack : The main object that creates the dealer and players.

Step 3 - Analyse Relationships 

- Card : 
	- A card has a value (ace -> king)
	- A card has a suite type (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades) 
	
- Deck :
	- A deck is composed of 52 cards, it creates the individual cards that make up the deck.

	- A dealer can deal the cards to the player.
	- A dealer is the object that controls the game.
