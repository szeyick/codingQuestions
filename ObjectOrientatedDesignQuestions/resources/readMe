Object Oriented Design - 

The idea behind these questions is to sketch out classes and methods to a problem. 

How to approach OOD questions -

Step 1 - Handle Ambiguity

The questions about design are intentionally vague to test whether you make assumptions or will clarify the question.

When asked about OOD questions, it is usually a good idea to ask who will be using it and how, perhaps to also ask 
about the six W's - Who, What, When, Where, How and Why?

Step 2 - Define the Core Objects

After understanding the question and requirements, consider what the "core objects" are. 

Step 3 - Analyse Relationships

Determine how the objects are related and how they interact with each other. Which objects of the system are single instance
objects and which objects can be instantiated multiple times. As you develop the relationships between the objects, you may
need to re-clarify the requirements.

Step 4 - Investigate Actions

Identify the key actions that the objects must do to interact with one another.
