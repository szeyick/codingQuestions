# Coding Questions

This respository contains Java solutions to coding questions that I have come across. Aside from the code, it will contain a description of the solution.

<h2>List:</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Find the sum from a given expression represented as a string</li>
<br>
<p>
Given an input string that represents an arithmetic expression (i.e. "1111*2+10*10*2+1"), calculate and output the total of the expression. The input will always be a positive integer, and the operations are * and +. From the given expression, the output total will be 2423.
