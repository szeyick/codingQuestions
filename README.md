This respository contains Java solutions to coding questions that I have come across. Aside from the code, it will contain a description of the solution.

<h2>List:</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Find the sum from a given expression represented as a string
<br>
<p>
Given an input string that represents an arithmetic expression (i.e. "1111*2+10*10*2+1"), calculate and output the total of the expression. The input will always be a positive integer, and the operations are * and +. From the given expression, the output total will be 2423.
<p>
</li>
<li>Given a linked list, detect if there is a loop.
<br>
<p>
If the list contains a cycle, your function must return true. If the list does not contain a cycle, it must return false. 
<p>
</li>
<p>
</li>
<li>Hash Tables: Ransom Note
<br>
<p>
Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print Yes if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print No.
<p>
</li>
<p>
</li>
<li>Reverse Polish Notiation Calculator.
<br>
<p>
Implement a calculator that uses a stack to do Reverse Polish Notation.
